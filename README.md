## Using the Launch scripts with Keyboard shortcuts on Ubuntu

The `launch-*` scripts are best run from keyboard shortcuts which you
can setup here:

Load the setting app and find the Keyboard shortcuts here:

![Keyboard Shortcut](docs/images/settings.png)

Then at the bottom, hidden away, you can add custom shortcuts:

![Custom Shortcut](docs/images/custom-shortcuts.png)

Then you would add the settings here:

![Custom Setting](docs/images/custom-shortcut-setting.png)

I do "Alt-1" for vim, "Alt-2" for terminal, "Alt-Q" for email and
"Alt-W" for google chrome.
